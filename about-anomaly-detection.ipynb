    "1. Anomaly detection is crucial in fraud detection, corruption, or even just detecting outliers (could be trying to figure out who is in a certain customer segment). \n",
    "2. A common application is to try to detect purchase fraud, or identity fraud, etc...\n",

    "2. Outliers could negatively impact assumptions in 'safe activity' on computer networks, bank activity, etc... identifying them in these cases is pretty essential for stable activity. "
